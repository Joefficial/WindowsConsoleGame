# WindowsConsoleGame
This was an old NHTI lab exercise where we had to work with OOP concepts generally.
 I ended up making a map system and movement at etc to make a fully playable game out of the lab (which was originally just a simple excercise with a couple .h files and a runner to print to the console) because I had some extra free time and it was great fun
